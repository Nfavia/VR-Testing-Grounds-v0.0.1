# VR Testing Grounds v0.0.1
 I am testing mechanics that I will want to use for possible VR games. I started this project just to create and test some mechanics that I want to see in VR games or that I just want to see if I can make.

 I am currently using a Valve Index for this and thus the only input maps being used are for that hardware. This will change in future updates but for now the only functionality is with the Valve Index.

 I am also using the VRE Plugin for much of the project, I may change this in the future to be more in line with UE's format and to not have confusion for others who may want to check out this project. For now though you can check out that plugin here: https://vreue4.com
